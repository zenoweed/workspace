# workspace
Have you ever wanted to just start pasting and typing stuff but didn't want to go throught the hassle of:
1. Creating a folder
2. Creating a file
3. Opening it in your faviorite code editor

Then after all that start doin what you do best?

Well that is what workspace is all about.

Presently you will need to make it an alias in ~/.bash_aliases but bin support is comming soon.
